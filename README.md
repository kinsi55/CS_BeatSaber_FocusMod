## Ever tried to take a peek at your Accuracy while playing only to miss the next block?

This mod allows you to configure a minimum amount of necessary "downtime" in a map with no blocks (And walls / bombs) required for the Accuracy to be visible so you can focus on hitting block. If you're a streamer you can also chose to hide it only in VR and keep it on the desktop
